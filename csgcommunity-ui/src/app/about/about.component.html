    <h2 class="subheading-2">How we formed</h2>
    <p class="para">
      The founders of Cerberus Stomping Grounds or CSG community have been playing the ARMA
      games together since early 2014.
      We met on the Definitive Gaming and Stalk & Strike ARMA 2 wasteland servers, and developed our team coordination
      further through the popular mod of DayZ, then Epoch and eventually Overpoch.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
      ARMA 3 was soon added to the mix, and we have been through many communities and game types ever since. Everything
      from Altis Life to Exile to Milsim, we've done it at some point. We've all partaken in varying communities and
      responsibilities within those communities, and have gained a very well rounded knowledge of the functionality of
      ARMA 3 and what it takes to be a part of and run a successful community.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
      We are a dedicated group of skilled players that have decided to put our experience and deep knowledge of the
      game that we love into a server we hope you will enjoy.
    </p>
