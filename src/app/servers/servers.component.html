    Many hours of work have been put towards giving the traders a signature
    apocalyptic look. A large variety of special features have been added to
    further increase functionality and immersion such as extra detailing, trader
    animations and apocalyptic soundtracks playing from the radios.
  </p>
  <h2 class="subheading-2 csgOrange unselectable">Our Map</h2>
  <h3 class="subheading-1 csgWhite unselectable">Map Development</h3>
  <p class="para csgWhite unselectable">
    New areas have been added to the map such as the improved North East
    Airfield and Custom Built military bases containing hidden secrets to the
    origin of the Apocalypse. The downfall of society is evident all through the
    map. Everything from soundtracks, to custom weather scripts have been added
    to create a new environment that captures some of the original DayZ magic.

  <h3 class="subheading-1 csgWhite unselectable">Unique Traders</h3>
  <p class="para csgWhite unselectable">
    Each trader has been built with a backstory in mind.
  </p>
  <p class="para csgWhite unselectable">
    The Klen Trader, once a popular campground, and summer getaway was overtaken
    by the virus and abandoned for many years. Survivors later stumbled upon it,
    and fortified it as their new home, transporting many crates from the Rify
    ship wreck to be used as walls. The stockpile of loot they built up is now
    for bargain to other survivors.
  </p>
  <p class="para csgWhite unselectable">
    The Stary Sobor Trader has a similar story to Klen. The old factory was
    abandoned after the outbreak of the virus, and several survivors hid their
    supplies deep inside the concrete jungles of the installation. As their
    group expanded, so did their gear stockpile until they decided to barter it
    away to the highest bidder.
  </p>
  <p class="para csgWhite unselectable">
    The Zelenogorsk trader, the largest hospital center in Chernarus, was over
    loaded with the sick as the outbreak spread. Because of its importance, U.N.
    Forces were quick to reinforce the installation, and protect the hospital
    from any desperate survivors attempting to steal the medical supplies there.
    Many fights broke out around the premise, hence all the carnage that
    surrounds the trade zone's walls. It now stands as a beacon of hope for the
    small remaining population of Chernarus and offers help to those who come to
    them without hostile intent.

  <h3 class="subheading-1 csgWhite unselectable">Custom Locations</h3>
  <p class="para csgWhite unselectable">
    Many new military bases, sites, and evac sites have been added for increased
    military presence and gear. Civilian houses are not chocked full of
    automatic assault rifles, as is often the case on Exile servers. For this
    reasons, you must venture out to the higher risk sites to gain higher
    quality loot.
